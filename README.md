# X-Division
X-Division is a complete overhauled game experience, featuring an vast amount of different enemies to capture, a new and improved, aggressive AI, 186 new weapons including katanas, 9 vehicles and 3 mechs and 13 sets of armour.

New revised Aircraft game , crafted by me which builds and extends on the existing aircraft mechanic and polishes it to the extreme. New mechanic, hit and run tactics,  new alien weapons and more .. so totally not what drages planned :). 22 new aircrafts from which 5 are alien interceptor to recruit and 24 aircraft weapons.

#Charons Changes, Psi, Sounds
Charons Changes was a forerunner project to test several changes before they were commited to the main branch but has since been integrated as mandatory for X-Division. It now contains slightly different code and is subject to change quicker than the main X-Division folder.
